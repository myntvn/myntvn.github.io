### [Puzzle Game](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zenbi.game.puzzle.treasure)

From the beginning of this year, to practice TypeScript more, I started developing this game using Cocos Creator and released to the Google Play store. I studied Cocos Creator instead of Unity, which is perhap the most common framework for game development now, because I want to be more proficient in Typescript.

### Music app
My first Android application is an online music app. I created it when I started studying Android development at the end of 2015. It took me only 2 weeks to complete the application but it got 1.5 million downloads, I was lucky. It’s not in the store anymore, but you can have a look at it at [link](https://nhc-san-nonstop-tng-hp.en.uptodown.com/android)
